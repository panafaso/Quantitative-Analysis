The project focuses on analyzing textual datasets by calculating key statistical indicators such as:
Type-Token Ratio (TTR), H-Point, R1 Indicator, Entropy, Lambda (Î›), Average Token Length (ATL), Repeat Rate (RR)
Key tasks include:Data preprocessing and segmentation, Calculation of descriptive statistics for each text segment, Visualization of indicator distributions (histograms, KDE plots, boxplots), Outlier detection and statistical interpretation (skewness, kurtosis), Basic risk analysis related to vocabulary diversity and data variability
